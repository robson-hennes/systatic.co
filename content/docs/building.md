When you have made changes to your content or views then you'll need to rebuild your site.

To rebuild your site run the following command from the root of your Systatic project.

```
php systatic build
```

Systatic will generate static HTML files and place them in your output directory, wherever that might be. By default, that directory is `dist`.
